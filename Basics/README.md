# ðŸ“˜ Basics of C++ for DSA

Welcome to the **Basics** folder! This section covers foundational C++ programming concepts crucial for a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each topic below contains explanations and code examples to strengthen your grasp of core C++ principles.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- [**Flowchart & Pseudocode**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Flowchart%20%26%20Psudeocode)  
  Learn how to visualize logic using flowcharts and structure your ideas with pseudocode before coding.

- [**Variables, Data Types & Operators**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Variable%2C%20Data%20Types%20%26%20Operators)  
  Understand how to declare variables, utilize various data types, and apply operators for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

- [**Conditional Statements & Loops**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Conditional%20Statements%20%26%20Loops)  
  Control the flow of your program using conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `switch` to implement decision-making.

- [**Patterns**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Patterns)  
  Master loops and fundamental programming by designing patterns.

- [**Functions**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Functions)
  Dive into defining and using functions to create reusable code, structure your program, and enhance readability.

- [**Binary Number System**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Binary%20Number%20System)  
  Explore the binary representation of numbers, crucial for understanding bit-level operations and algorithm optimizations. 

- [**Miscellaneous Concepts**](https://github.com/Deeptig9138/DSA-in-CPP/tree/main/Basics/Miscellaneous%20Concepts)  
  Learn operators like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`) to perform low-level operations efficiently. Understand fundamental data types and how modifiers like `signed`, `unsigned`, `long`, and `short` alter their properties.
