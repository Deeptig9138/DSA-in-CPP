# ðŸ“˜ Basics of C++ for DSA

Welcome to the **Basics** folder! This section covers foundational C++ programming concepts crucial for a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each topic below contains explanations and code examples to strengthen your grasp of core C++ principles.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Flowchart & Pseudocode**  
  Learn how to visualize logic using flowcharts and structure your ideas with pseudocode before coding.

- **Variables, Data Types & Operators**  
  Understand how to declare variables, utilize various data types, and apply operators for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

- **Conditional Statements & Loops**  
  Control the flow of your program using conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `switch` to implement decision-making.

- **Patterns**  
  Master loops and fundamental programming by designing patterns.

- **Functions**  
  Dive into defining and using functions to create reusable code, structure your program, and enhance readability.

- **Miscellaneous Concepts**  
  Explore the binary representation of numbers, crucial for understanding bit-level operations and algorithm optimizations. Understand fundamental data types and how modifiers like `signed`, `unsigned`, `long`, and `short` alter their properties.

- **Bitwise Operators**  
  Learn operators like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`) to perform low-level operations efficiently.
