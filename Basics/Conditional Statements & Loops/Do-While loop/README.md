# Loops in C++
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.

### **Do-While Loop**
Executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

This is the basic syntax
```cpp
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

#### Even if the condition is false, the code will run atleast once because we are first doing the work and then checking the condition
