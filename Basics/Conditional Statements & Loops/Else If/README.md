# Conditional Statements in C++
Conditional statements control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.

### **Else If Ladder**
This is the basic syntax
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
```
