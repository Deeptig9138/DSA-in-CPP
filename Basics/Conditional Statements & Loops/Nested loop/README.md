# Loops in C++
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.

### **Nested Loops**
A loop inside another loop.

This is the basic syntax
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < outer_limit; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < inner_limit; j++) {
        // Code to execute in the nested loop
    }
}
```
