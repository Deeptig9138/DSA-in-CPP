# Loops in C++
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.

### **While Loop**
This is the basic syntax
```cpp
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute as long as condition is true
}
```

### **Infinite While Loop**
An infinite loop runs indefinitely because its condition is always true. Use with caution as it can cause the program to hang.

This is the basic syntax
```cpp
while (true) {
    // Code to execute continuously
}
```
