# Square Pattern in C++

## Overview
This directory contains a simple C++ program to print a **Square Pattern**. Square patterns are a great way to practice nested loops and are fundamental for understanding how to manage rows and columns in a 2D format using programming.

## Example Output
Below are examples of different types of square patterns that can be printed:

### 1. **Solid Square** : Let n = 4, n here is Number of Lines
 ```
      ****
      ****
      ****
      ****
 ```

### 2. **Hollow Square**

### 3. **Number Square**

## Program Logic Explanation

### 1. Solid Square
Uses nested loops:
The outer loop controls the number of rows.
The inner loop prints * for each column in a row.

### 2. Hollow Square
Prints * on the boundaries (first and last rows, first and last columns).
The inner space is left blank using conditions in the inner loop.

### 3. Number Square
Each row prints a constant number, starting from 1 up to N (where N is the number of rows/columns).
