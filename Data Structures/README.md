# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures

Welcome to the **Data Structures** folder! This section covers essential data structures that form the backbone of computer science. Each topic includes detailed explanations and code examples, allowing you to deepen your understanding of these fundamental structures. In this document, we will explore data structures, starting from basic classifications and progressing to more advanced structures.

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science, providing a way to organize and store data efficiently. The choice of data structure plays a crucial role in algorithm performance, determining how data is accessed, modified, and manipulated. A well-chosen data structure can optimize memory usage and processing speed.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

A. **Primitive Data Structures**
Primitive data structures are the most basic types of data structures that represent a single value. These are typically built into programming languages and serve as the foundation for more complex data structures.

- **Integer:** A whole number.
- **Float:** A number with a decimal point.
- **Character:** A single letter or symbol.
- **Boolean:** Represents either true or false.
- **String:** A sequence of characters (in some languages, treated as an array of characters).

B. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**
Non-primitive data structures are more complex structures that are derived from primitive data types. These structures can store multiple values or organize data in more advanced ways.

1. **Linear Data Structures**
Linear data structures store data elements in a sequential manner. Each element in a linear data structure has a unique predecessor and successor (except for the first and last elements).

- [**Arrays:**]() A collection of elements that can be accessed by their index, typically in contiguous memory.
- [**Linked Lists:**]() A series of nodes where each node points to the next, allowing dynamic memory allocation.
- [**Stacks:**]() Data structure where elements are added and removed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
- [**Queues:**]() Data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures organize data in a hierarchical or graph-like structure where each element may have multiple relationships with other elements.

- [**Trees:**]() A hierarchical structure with nodes representing data and edges connecting the nodes. Examples include binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
- [**Graphs:**]() A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they may contain cycles.

## Why Are Data Structures Important?

- **Efficiency:** The right data structure can make algorithms faster and reduce memory usage.
- **Optimization:** Selecting the appropriate data structure can optimize code, especially for large datasets.
- **Problem Solving:** Complex problems like searching, sorting, pathfinding, and database management heavily rely on data structures to provide efficient solutions.
