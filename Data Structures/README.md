## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- [**Arrays:**]() Learn about arrays, the simplest and most widely used data structure for storing elements in a contiguous block of memory. 

- [**Linked Lists:**]() Understand linked lists, where elements (nodes) are connected by pointers, enabling efficient insertion and deletion operations.

- [**Stacks:**]() Master the stack data structure, which follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, and explore its applications in algorithms like DFS.

- [**Queues:**]() Dive into queues, which follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, and learn how they are used in scheduling and buffering data.

- [**Trees:**]() Study trees, especially binary trees, and understand their use in hierarchical data representation and various search and traversal algorithms.

- [**Graphs:**]() Explore graphs, a versatile structure used to represent networks and relationships between objects, and learn about algorithms like BFS and DFS.

- [**Hash Tables:**]() Learn about hash tables, which allow for fast data retrieval using key-value pairs, and understand concepts like hashing and collision resolution.
